	* Packages2packages_tb.pl: Packages2packages_tb.pl loads
	descriptions into a psql table. This table is used by
	packages_tb2Packages.pl to produce a Packages file with all the
	packages independently from an architecture. Since
	packages_tb2Packages.pl does not dump the md5 into this Packages
	file, there is no need to load the md5 from
	Packages2packages_tb.pl (and no need to compute these md5).
	Note: The SQL layout should be adjusted, but I have some secret
	goal to get rid of the complete table anyway.

	* packages_tb2Packages.pl: Remove dead code. parse_header_format
	inherited from Packages2packages_tb.pl. Hashes %descrmd5,
	%descrlist, %total_counts, %important_packages not used. We do not
	need LWP::Simple, strftime, md5_hex.

	Introduce changes already applied to the DDTP server
	* db2web.sh: Add link to the Squeeze and Wheezy statistics.
	* db2web.sh: Changed y axes (no more logscale and limits changed
	from 0:15000 to 1:27000).
	* sql_layout.txt: Add table package_version_tb.
	* Packages2db.pl: Populate the package_version_tb table in
	addition to version_tb.
	* sql_layout.txt: Add table suggestion_tb.
	* Packages2db.sh: Comment out gaia, lenny and etch
	* Packages2db.sh: Added Squeeze and Wheezy
	* ddt.cgi: Use the package_version_tb table instead of version_tb
	table to display the package and version instead of just the
	version.
	* db_change_lang.pl: Do not convert pt to pt_BR anymore.
	* db_change_lang.pl: Convert km to km_KH.
	* Translation2db.sh: For some reasons, this script, which do not
	seem to be used, was changed to remove consecutive duplicate lines
	(maybe to remove extra empty lines?).
	* update.sh: Compute the statistics for wheezy and squeeze instead
	of lenny and etch
	* update0.5.sh: Likewise.
	* completeTranslations.pl: It seems the intent of the change is
	that the list of descriptions which are checked for being already
	completed is extended without regard of any existing translations
	for their package.
	* file2Translation.sh: Process wheezy instead of lenny (in
	addition to sid)
	* file2Translation.sh: To check the validity of ftp-master files,
	download the list of packages and versions for squeeze instead of
	etch.
	* file2Translation.sh: Remove consecutive duplicate lines from the
	./file2Translation.pl output (maybe to remove extra empty lines?).
	* file2Translation.pl (get_packageinfos): Only return the md5 and
	not the package.
	* file2Translation.pl: get_description_ids and foreach (package,
	version) loop replaced by make_translation_file(). Use the
	package_version_tb table to pick description for a package and
	version. + other changes
	* Packages2packages_tb.sh: Updated list of architectures. Removed
	alpha, arm, hppa, hurd-i386, m68k. Added kfreebsd-i386,
	kfreebsd-amd64.
	* Packages2packages_tb.sh: Updated list of distributions: sarge
	etch lenny changed to squeeze wheezy (i.e. oldstable dropped)
	* Packages2packages_tb.sh: Report failure to wget.
	* logrotate.config: comment out the compress options (this is the
	default).
